# ImageProcessing-TextDetection

This repository contains a text detection system implemented with TensorFlow Lite. The system can automatically detect text in images. It utilizes the Efficient and Accurate Scene Text Detector (EAST) algorithm for text detection. The provided code offers features such as:

- Cloning the EAST algorithm from a GitHub repository.
- Uploading and processing images for text detection.
- Converting the EAST model to TensorFlow Lite format for efficient execution on small devices.
- Performing text detection inference on input images.
- Post-processing the results to draw bounding boxes around detected text.
